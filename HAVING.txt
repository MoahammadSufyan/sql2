HAVING CLAUSE

--HAVING CLAUSE IS USED TO SPECIFY CONDITIONS LIKE WHERE CLAUSE.

--BUT HAVING CLAUSE IS USED WITH GROUP BY COMMAND.

--WE CANNOT USE WHERE CLAUSE WITH GROUP BY COMMAND.

--Where clause is used for filtering rows and having clause is used to filtering groups.

--WHERE CLAUSE DOES NOT WORK WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS LIKE SUM,MIN,MAX,COUNT,AVG..

--WE CAN USE HAVING CLAUSE WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS.

--WHERE CLAUSE CAN BE USED BEFORE THE GROUP BY CLAUSE BUT NOT AFTER THAT.

--WE CAN USE WHERE AND HAVING TOGETHER IN A SINGLE QUERY.

--From the point of view of performance having is slower than where and should be avoided when possible.
